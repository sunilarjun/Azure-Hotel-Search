# Quickstart sample for Azure Cognitive Search in .NET

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Demonstrates using the Azure Cognitive Search .NET SDK to create an index, load it with documents, and execute a few queries. The index is modeled on a subset of the Hotels dataset, reduced for readability and comprehension. Index definition and documents are included in the code.

This .NET Core console application is featured in [Quickstart: Create your first app - Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/tutorial-csharp-create-first-app). When you run the program, a console window emits output messages for each step: deleting and then re-creating a hotels-quickstart index, loading documents, running queries. This sample uses the [.NET SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/?term=microsoft.azure.search) and runs on an Azure Cognitive Search service using connection information that you provide.
